if you want it only for 1 game do "if game.PlaceId == gamesId then"


start med "local library = loadstring(game:GetObjects("rbxassetid://7657867786")[1].Source)()"

want this you can "local Wait = library.subs.Wait"


next do "local yourName = library:CreateWindow({Name = "Your Name"

want others to custimase it then do "Themeable = {Info = "What you want"}

then end it med "})"


next do "local NameTab = yourName:CreateTab({Name = "What u want to call your Tab"})"

you are gonna need to make a like box that you can put your buttons og other stoff you want to make it easyer for others to find your hacks "local NameSection = NameTab:CreateSection({
Name = "You can name it"

end it med "})"


want to make a Button to your Section do "NameSection:AddButton({Name = 'Name your Button', Callback = function() "Your Script Here" end})"


if you want to make your script work for anather game do "elseif game.PlaceId == gameId then"


og to finish your script off do "end"
